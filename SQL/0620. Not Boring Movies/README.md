# [LIKE Operator](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-like/)

The **LIKE** operator is a logical operator that tests whether a string contains a specified pattern or not.

The **LIKE** operator is used in the **WHERE** clause of the **SELECT , DELETE, and UPDATE** statements to filter data based on patterns.

MySQL provides two wildcard characters for constructing patterns: **percentage %** and **underscore _**.

* The **percentage ( % )** wildcard matches any string of **zero or more characters**.

For example, **s%** matches any string starts with the character s such as sun and six.

* The **underscore ( _ )** wildcard matches any **single character**.

For example, The **se_** matches any string starts with  se and is followed by any character such as see and sea.

# [MOD() function](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_mod.asp)

The MOD() function returns the remainder of a number divided by another number.
